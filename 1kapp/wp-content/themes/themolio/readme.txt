=== THEMOLIO ===

* By Nischal Maniar, http://www.nischalmaniar.com

=== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ===

* Unzip the theme folder into /wp-content/themes directory
* Activate the theme after installation
* Go to Themolio Theme Settings to customize the appearance of the theme

=== DISPLAYING POST FEATURED IMAGES ===

* After activating the theme the featured images will probably not look the right size. To fix this it is highly recommended that you install and run the "Regenerate Thumbnails" plugin available at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/
* This plugin will regenerate all your image sizes and apply the Themolio image sizes to your featured images

=== GRID LAYOUT ===

* Themolio offers two type of Grid layouts 1) Top-Down 2) Left-Right
* Top-Down will arrange your posts from top to down instead of sideways. This will make your grid look prettier eliminating any whitespace caused due to difference in post size
* Left-Right will arrange your posts in a portfolio style making it easier to read but if your posts are not of the same size then it can create some white spaces in between

=== DEMO ===

* Check out the demo available on my site to see how the Grid looks: http://www.nischalmaniar.com/themolio
