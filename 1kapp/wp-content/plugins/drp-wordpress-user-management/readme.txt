== Frequently Asked Questions ==

How do i see if a user is online?

You will see a green dot next to their name

What is the banned ips area for?

Each time you ban a user, their ip or ips will appear under there for reference purposes, you can delete the list if it grows to big

What is the settings area for?

It let's you add your own custom Banned message to users who you ban, the next time they login, they will see this message.
It let's set a time limit for checking if a user is online
It let's set if you want to ban their IP when you ban the user, if you check this and save it will ban their username and their ip address

Does this work with custom login areas?

It has not been tested with custom only default wordpress login area

Why would I not ban their ip?

Let's say a person is using an internet cafe, you may not want to ban their IP just their username in which case leave the checkbox unchecked under settings
this way you will only ban the User and not other people who may be using the cafe for accessing the site.

Is this plugin free?

Yes.

How much support will you give for this?

Look, it's free we will do best effort but understandably no one is paying us to dedicate time to providing this. Leave a comment on the site and we will probably take it into consideration if we update it
if it's a stand out issue we will get to it as soon as we can but no guarantees as again its free.
